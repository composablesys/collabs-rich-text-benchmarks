# analysis

Node.js program that analyzes log files recorded from `../client/` and `../server/`.

## Usage

### Install

```bash
npm ci
```

### Run

```bash
npm start <output dir> <input dirs...>
```

where:

- `output dir` is the directory to output data. This folder will be shared by all experiments. We append one line to `<output dir>/summary.csv`, write time-series data to `<output dir>/<exp desc>.csv`, and also output Chrome CPU profiles and framework saved states for each trial.
  - To view a CPU profile, upload it to the Chrome devtools profiler. The `highFreq` profile uses 10,000 samples/second, while the normal profiles use the default 1,000 samples/second.
- Each `input dir` contains data for one experiment, e.g. `allActive-048-collabs/`. It must be in the format generated by `client/local_exp.sh` or by the server with the `'c'` ("collect logs") option: one subfolder per trial, each containing the server log and all client logs for that trial.
